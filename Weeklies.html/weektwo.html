    <h1>How is Ayn Rand's philosophy relevant today?</h1>
    <p>Ayn Rand’s philosophy is that each man must live as an individual in himself, only holding himself accountable to pursuing his own happiness. I think this is very relevant today. Social media platforms have allowed for the commodification of the self, creating a whole group of people (top tier influencers)  who make money off doing exactly what they want to do all the time. The fact that these people exist - people who are asked to go to Coachella with artist passes and stay in a pre-paid home, or take exotic trips with their boyfriends - make the masses believe that this lifestyle is something they too can achieve. Therefore, attending the most expensive coffee shops and bars is imperative to their self commodification. People are more inclined to do things they want to do with more frequency and vigor in hopes of boosting their online image. While one would think this is a healthy practice, it can be extremely costly, sometimes harmful.
Before Vine died, people would do ridiculous, sometimes offensive, things “for the vine”. Literally, the phrase “do it for the vine” became justification for people doing anything they wanted. These ten second videos that would go viral often involved physical comedy, leading some people to get hurt in the process. This desensitization to pain caused by the mass intake of harsh, fast physical comedy, could be what lead to Jake Paul’s diluded idea to post a video in suicide forest.
I recognize I’m really digging into Ayn Rand’s ideology, but I can’t take it seriously considering she lived so hypocritically. She used her ideology to justify her adulterous affair with Nathan, but then couldn’t respect his desire to pursue someone else. I define her ideology as much by what she preached, as by what she practiced which is this double standard/cognitive dissonance.
Often times people have one in person identity and a completely separate online identity. I say this, thinking of female friends of mine at my Catholic high school. They would preach chastity and slut shame other girls at school, but post pictures of their underwear on their “finsta” accounts. I think the concept of the “finsta”, fake-instagram account, allows people to live out their alter-egos. Often times these personas are the people they villainize in person.
In summary, I’m not a fan of Ayn Rand’s ideology and I see it active in our culture today in a very negative way.</p>
